eye_ar_thresh: if the eye aspect ratio falls below a certain threshold and then rises above the threshold we register a blink
eye_ar_consec_frame:indicate that three successive fames with an ete aspect ratio less than eye_ar_thresh must happen in order for a blink to be registred

counter: total number of successive frames that have an eye aspect ratio less than eye_ar_thresh
total: total number of blinks that have taken place while the script has been running

the dlib library uses pre_trained face detector which is based on a modification to the hog and linear svm method for object detection
